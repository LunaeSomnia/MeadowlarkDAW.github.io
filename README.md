```bash
# Install all the dependencies needed to run/build the project
npm i

# Execute the 'dev' macro, running the app in http://127.0.0.1:5173

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
